# NYC Citi Bike Challenge

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a set of visualizations that show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour and day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user by gender for each hour and day of the week.

## Summary

With all of these visualizations, we were able to identify peak riding hours, busiest days during the week, and breakdowns by gender, hour, and usertype. We can see that citi bike is a very successful business and will likely succeed in another busy city, Des Moines, Iowa. 2 additional visualizations I would like to see would be a breakdown of the age of riders and whether or not the users are tourists or live in the city.
